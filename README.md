## Quickstart

1. `npm install`
2. Customize the package.json file with the information about your project. Don't forget to change the license if you don't want MIT! Once a license is chosen it is hard to (legally) change it
3. Replace the code from src/ with your code
4. Add the files you want to delete after the build (if there are any) in rollup.config.js. Instead of deleting them, you can just add them to .gitignore
5. Run `npm publish` and wait for people to use your library
